# About the Project
This project is motivated by the killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed in the United States. This project will look broadly at police violence in the United States through analysis of data on individuals killed at the hands of police from 2013 to 2020, and will also focus specifically on the Black Lives Matter protests that have occurred in 2020. This project is ultimately being completed to assess the instances of excessive use of force by police and to determine whether instances of excessive force are concentrated demographically and geographically.

&nbsp;
