## Hypothesis tests

Testing influence of mental illness symptoms. THIS DOESNâ€™T WORK -
unclear why, will revisit.

``` r
fit_null = glm(MI ~ race_rec, data = mpv_df_mi, family = "binomial")
fit_alt = glm(MI ~ race_rec + gender, data = mpv_df_mi, family = "binomial")

anova(fit_null, fit_alt) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```
