### Title

Our tentative project title is: **Mapping Police Violence Across the United States: An Analysis of 2020 Anti-Police Brutality Protests**

### Motivation

This project aims to explore the number of protests across the United States, spurred by the killing of George Floyd in the summer of 2020. This project is being done to ultimately assess the instances of excessive use of force by police, and to determine whether instances of excessive force are concentrated geographically.

### Intended Final Products

Our final project will be an HTML website with links to a mapping project.

**no idea how this differs from planned analyses lol help**

### Planned Analyses/ Visualizations/ Coding Challenges

#### Planned Analyses

We will conduct descriptive analyses of excessive force and other characterizations of protests. We also plan on including an interactive table with geographic specifications detailing protests and characterizations of protests. Based on the counts available, we may be able to explore associations between geographic areas and instances of protests/excessive force (using metro/rural classifications, or other).

**please add to the above here with what you want to do with the other data source and other analyses you want to run. also is this too vague?**

#### Visualizations

This project will include an interactive map with each recorded protest over time, in order to ultimately demonstrate the widespread nature of the protests nationwide.

#### Coding Challenges

We anticipate that small cell counts will be available for some of the outcomes we are interested in, which may limit our ability to run analyses. The data also requires quite a bit of coding. It will also be challenging to create an interactive, time-varying map.
