### Title

Our tentative project title is: **Mapping Police Violence Across the
United States: An Analysis of Police Violence By County Demographics**

### Motivation

This project is motivated by the protests occurring in the United States
against police brutality, that were spurred by the killing of George
Floyd. Along with the violence at protests, this project will examine
police violence more broadly and will analyze police violence and
sociodemographic factors in the United States.

This project aims to assess the instances of excessive use of force by
police and to determine whether instances of excessive force are
concentrated demographically and geographically.

### Intended Final Products

Our final project will be an HTML website with links to a mapping
project. There will be various tabs on the website with different
information in each tab and different ways of viewing the data. The
landing page of the website will include a brief background on the issue
the project is centered around and will give an overview of everything
included on the website. There will also be information included on the
landing page regarding brief descriptions of how the raw data was
manipulated and analyzed to form the final products.

### Anticipated Data Sources

The central data source for the raw data will be the US Crisis Monitor
from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). This
data gives information on police violence specifically during 2020
following the death of George Floyd. There will also be data regarding
police violence, the results of police violence against certain groups
of people in the United States, and incarceration trends and their
correlation to police violence from New Jersey Projects and
Investigations, Fatal Encounters organization, and Prison Policy
Initiative organization.

**Maybe letâ€™s avoid looking into corrections?**

We also plan on using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to
explore income by county, and correlations with incidents of protests or
police violence.

### Planned Analyses/ Visualizations/ Coding Challenges

#### Planned Analyses

We will conduct descriptive analyses of excessive force and other
characterizations of protests. We also plan on including an interactive
table with geographic specifications detailing protests and
characterizations of protests. Based on the counts available, we may be
able to explore associations between geographic areas and instances of
protests/excessive force (using metro/rural classifications, or other).
We will additionally explore the relationship between income and police
violence and the occurrence of protests, through statistical analyses.

**please add to the above here with what you want to do with the other
data source and other analyses you want to run. also is this too vague?
how detailed is he wanting it? and should we be doing more complex
analyses than just descriptives? // based on the example projects that
he linked us, all of them seem to have some sort of
regression/prediction modeling; also found this site that has their own
dataset compiled from other datasets
<https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/aboutthedata>**

**Something that might be interesting is to compare election
data/changes 2016 and 2020 with recorded protests in the same area
geographically to see if there are statistically significant
changes/relationship. This could also just be a visual map.**

#### Visualizations

This project will include an interactive map with each recorded protest
over time, in order to ultimately demonstrate the widespread nature of
the protests nationwide. There will also be plots and tables showing the
associations between various variables within the datasets.

We also plan on creating a geographic heatmap of police violence
incidents. This could be overlayed with other data, such as protest
data, to observe interactions of different factors. We additionally plan
on mapping income by county, and creating a heatmap based off of this
data, and overlaying protest data on this map.

#### Coding Challenges

We anticipate that small cell counts will be available for some of the
outcomes we are interested in, which may limit our ability to run
analyses. The data also requires quite a bit of coding. It will also be
challenging to create an interactive, time-varying map, since we have
had few opportunities to do this in homeworks and assignments thus far
in the course. Additionally, the data might not be sufficiently
comprehensive or complete to generate robust statistical tests.
