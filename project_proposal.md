### Title

**Police Violence in the United States (2013-2020)**

### Motivation

This project is motivated by the killing of George Floyd and the
protests that followed in the United States. This project will look
broadly at police violence in the United States through analysis of data
on individuals killed at the hands of police from 2013 to 2020, and will
also focus specifically on the Black Lives Matter protests that have
occurred in 2020. This project is ultimately being completed to assess
the instances of excessive use of force by police and to determine
whether instances of excessive force are concentrated demographically
and geographically.

### Intended Final Products

Our final project will be an HTML website with links to a mapping
project. There will be various tabs on the website with different
information in each tab and different ways of viewing the data. The
landing page of the website will include a brief background on the issue
the project is centered around and will give a brief overview of
everything included on the website. There will also be a tab for the
full project report with information on the data and everything that was
manipulated and analyzed in the project. The rest of the tabs on the
website will cover descriptive analyses and models, regression analyses,
and interactive maps.

### Anticipated Data Sources

The central data source for the raw data will be the Mapping Police
Violence dataset from the Mapping Police Violence group. This dataset
includes information on individuals killed as a result of police
violence, including geographic data, demographic information, and data
surrounding the situation of the confrontation. There will also be data
from the US Crisis Monitor from the Armed Conflict Location and Event
Data Project (ACLED). This data gives information on police violence
specifically during 2020 protests following the death of George Floyd.
Other data used will include (include other data hereâ€¦)

### Planned Analyses/ Visualizations/ Coding Challenges

#### Planned Analyses

We will conduct descriptive analyses of force and violence resulting in
the death of individuals, and the characteristics of those individuals,
the confrontation, and the geographic locations the confrontations
happened in. We will also conduct descriptive analyses of excessive
force and other characterizations of 2020 protests. We plan on including
an interactive table with geographic specifications detailing protests
and characterizations of protests. Based on the counts available, we may
be able to explore associations between geographic areas and instances
of protests/excessive force (using metro/rural classifications, or
other). We plan to conduct multiple regression analyses as well focused
on the police violence on indivuduals from 2013 to 2020.

#### Visualizations

This project will include an interactive map with each recorded instance
of police violence over time, in order to ultimately demonstrate the
widespread nature of the police violence nationwide. There will also be
an interactive map included showing the locations of protests throughout
the United States during 2020. There will also be plots and tables
included in the project showing the associations between various
variables within all datasets.

#### Coding Challenges

We anticipate that small cell counts will be available for some of the
outcomes we are interested in, which may limit our ability to run
analyses. The data also requires quite a bit of coding. It will also be
challenging to create an interactive, time-varying map, since we have
had few opportunities to do this in homeworks and assignments thus far
in the course. We anticipate that missing data could be a challenge to
overcome in some of the datasets as well.
