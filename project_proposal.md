### Title

Our tentative project title is: **Mapping Police Violence Across the
United States: An Analysis of 2020 Anti-Police Brutality Protests**

### Motivation

This project aims to explore the number of protests across the United
States, spurred by the killing of George Floyd in the summer of 2020.
This project is being done to ultimately assess the instances of
excessive use of force by police, and to determine whether instances of
excessive force are concentrated geographically.

### Intended Final Products

Our final project will be an HTML website with links to a mapping
project.

**no idea how this differs from planned analyses lol help**

### Planned Analyses/ Visualizations/ Coding Challenges

#### Planned Analyses

We will conduct descriptive analyses of excessive force and other
characterizations of protests. We also plan on including an interactive
table with geographic specifications detailing protests and
characterizations of protests. Based on the counts available, we may be
able to explore associations between geographic areas and instances of
protests/excessive force (using metro/rural classifications, or other).

**please add to the above here with what you want to do with the other
data source and other analyses you want to run. also is this too vague?
how detailed is he wanting it? and should we be doing more complex
analyses than just descriptives?**

#### Visualizations

This project will include an interactive map with each recorded protest
over time, in order to ultimately demonstrate the widespread nature of
the protests nationwide.

#### Coding Challenges

We anticipate that small cell counts will be available for some of the
outcomes we are interested in, which may limit our ability to run
analyses. The data also requires quite a bit of coding. It will also be
challenging to create an interactive, time-varying map.

### Planned Timeline

**ok this proposal is due Nov 7, so this is based off a weekly timeline
since then and i think this is due.. dec ? also genuinely no gauge on
how long some of this will take us, feel free to edit and change dates**

|          November 7-14 | Data exploration, begin data cleaning, create team plan for appropriate data cleaning steps, complete data cleaning |
|         November 14-21 | Make plan for coding the map and for feasible descriptive analyses, run descriptive analyses, being coding map      |
|         November 21-28 | Finish coding map, make interactive table to go along with the map                                                  |
| November 28-December 5 | Create finished product, troubleshoot to ensure all the links work                                                  |
