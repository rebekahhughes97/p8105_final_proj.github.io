## Motivation

This project is overall motivated by the killing of George Floyd in 2020 and the protests and demonstrations that followed. Police violence and violence against protesters has been a highly talked about issue in 2020 thus far and we were interested in finding and analyzing data related to police violence and the Black Lives Matter protests.
